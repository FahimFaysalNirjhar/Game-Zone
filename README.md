## CSS Position Usage

The project demonstrates extensive use of CSS **positioning** for layout and interactivity:

- **Fixed Position**: Sidebar navigation uses `position: fixed` for mobile devices, allowing it to slide in/out smoothly.
- **Relative Position**: Images and hero section elements are aligned using `position: relative` for precise placement.
- **Responsive Adjustments**: Media queries adjust positions to maintain layout across different screen sizes (`absolute`, `relative`, and `fixed` as needed).
